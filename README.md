how to use Git and Github

First you need to download git and create a github account.

To create a local repository in git, you need to type $ git init

Every basic command in git starts with the code line $ git + the code. Examples:$ git add <file>(to add files to the index), $ git status( to check the status of the working tree), $ git commit(to commit changes in index).
  
To add html in git, you need to type $ git add index.html(this is how to add different languages in git
Git and github share alot of the same commands

In Github, you need to create an account. 

Github is a place where you store projects(code) and work with others on your projects or a group project.

The most important thing to know in github is a repository, it is where your code is stored and can be shared with others.

On the top left corner of the github, there is a Repositories with a small green box that says new.

That is where you click on new and create a repository.

You can code and type your projects in there but to save the changes you must click commit changes at the bottom of the page.

Pull request makes you download other repositories into your account and merge allows you to add different code to your projects.

One important thing to note is when you commit a change, there are two options available. One is commit directly to the master branch and one is create a new branch.

Usually you click commit to the master branch when you are working on your projects but when it is a group project and you are not the head of the group then you create a new branch for you line of code. 


Git:is a vcs(version control system) that is used to keep track of changes in source code.

Github: is a hosting service for git repositories

clone: is when you duplicate another repository and the data/code in it

Push:is when you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository.

Pull:is used to pull and download code/data from a defferent repository and uploads to the local repository

Branch:points out the last commint made and automatically moves forward when a commit is added to the repository.

Merge: takes code/data from different repositories and branches and pulls into a single branch(master branch)

Merge Conflict:occurs when you merge branches that have competing commits
